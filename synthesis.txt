What do you think we were trying to get you to learn with this challenge?
  How classes interact with each other.


Outline in words (at least 5-6 sentences) what your code is doing in order to solve this problem.
  My code is creating a collection of activity hashes, that the reunion class calls on.
  Allowing the ability to pull out totals or each individual piece, depending on what is
  needed.

What was the most difficult portion of this for you?
  I did not get to the ERB section, which was the most intimidating thing about this project.

What came naturally to you?
  Manipulating data to get the piece I wanted from a collection.
